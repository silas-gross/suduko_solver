-------------------SUDUKO SOLVER----------------------
This solver is a fairly simple version 
There are probably some improvements that may speed up the 
approach, but this was fairly simple to write and emplace

Not quite sure if I implemented the hueirstic correctly, 
but I do check in order of 1-9 and I think I have successfuly implied 
the heuristic value in the baktracking algorithm. 

For testing, I ran over 10 boards, line numbers given below with the 
time taken to reach solutions. 
I did run over the boards and do the benchmarking with a shell script,
included in the zip file

--------------------Test Boards---------------------
Test boards and output are in sudukos_test_start.txt and output_time_test.txt
